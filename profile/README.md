# Welcome to BeLiver on GitHub! 👋

## 🧑‍🔬 About Us

BeLiver is a **French biotech startup** 🇫🇷 based in Bordeaux, spun out from leading research institutions (CHU Bordeaux, INSERM/CNRS unit BRIC).

## 🔬 Our Mission

To revolutionize cancer care through **personalized medicine**. We are initially focused on **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**, aiming to significantly improve treatment outcomes by addressing the challenge of predicting patient-specific responses to therapies. Our ultimate goal is to empower oncologists with insightful tools 💡 for more effective and personalized therapeutic decisions.

## 📊 Our Approach

We develop innovative diagnostic solutions by integrating:
1.  **Deep Analysis of Patient Biology:** Analyzing comprehensive biological data derived directly from patient samples to understand the unique characteristics of their disease.
2.  **Advanced Artificial Intelligence:** Utilizing machine learning and deep learning models 🤖 to interpret this complex biological data.

Our integrated approach aims to translate deep biological insights into clear, actionable predictions of treatment efficacy for individual patients.

## 🧑‍💻 Our Presence on GitHub

BeLiver is committed to scientific rigor and transparency 🧑‍🔬.

While our core technology development happens internally, **we strongly support reproducible research**. Therefore, you may find **public repositories** here in the future, specifically containing code or supplementary materials associated with our **scientific publications** 📄.

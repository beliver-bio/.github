# Welcome to BeLiver on GitHub! 👋

## 🧑‍🔬 About Us

BeLiver is a **French biotech startup** 🇫🇷 based in Bordeaux, spun out from leading research institutions (CHU Bordeaux, INSERM/CNRS unit BRIC).

## 🔬 Our Mission

To revolutionize cancer care through **personalized medicine**. We are initially focused on **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**, aiming to significantly improve treatment outcomes by addressing the challenge of predicting patient-specific responses to therapies. Our ultimate goal is to empower oncologists with insightful tools 💡 for more effective and personalized therapeutic decisions.

## 📊 Our Approach

We develop innovative diagnostic solutions by integrating:
1.  **Deep Analysis of Patient Biology:** Analyzing comprehensive biological data derived directly from patient samples to understand the unique characteristics of their disease.
2.  **Advanced Artificial Intelligence:** Utilizing machine learning and deep learning models 🤖 to interpret this complex biological data.

Our integrated approach aims to translate deep biological insights into clear, actionable predictions of treatment efficacy for individual patients.

## 🧑‍💻 Our Presence on GitHub

BeLiver is committed to scientific rigor and transparency 🧑‍🔬.

While our core technology development happens internally, **we strongly support reproducible research**. Therefore, you may find **public repositories** here in the future, specifically containing code or supplementary materials associated with our **scientific publications** 📄.

## ⚗️ Our Science

The science powering the BeLiver technology:

- [Proteomic profiling of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma identifies predictive signatures of response to treatments, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.03.631224)

When treating advanced liver cancer (HCC), it's difficult to know beforehand which drug will work best for a specific patient. This study analyzed proteins in tiny tumor samples taken before treatment began. The researchers discovered unique protein patterns ("signatures") that could successfully predict whether patients were likely to respond well to two common treatments (atezolizumab/bevacizumab or sorafenib), suggesting this protein analysis approach could help doctors choose the most effective therapy for individual patients right from the start.

- [Spatial characterization of β-catenin-mutated hepatocellular adenoma subtypes by proteomic profiling of the tumor rim, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhepr.2023.100913)

Sometimes, even benign (non-cancerous) liver tumors with the same genetic mutation can look and act differently in different parts, like the edge versus the center. This research used detailed protein analysis to show that the cells at the very edge (rim) of certain benign liver tumors behave much more like normal liver cells than those in the tumor's core, likely due to differences in the local environment like blood flow. This highlights that a tumor's location and surroundings, not just its genes, play a big role in its characteristics.

- [Proteomic Profiling of Hepatocellular Adenomas Paves the Way to Diagnostic and Prognostic Approaches, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31826)

Accurately identifying the specific subtype of benign liver tumors (HCAs) is important because different types have different risks (like bleeding or turning into cancer). This pioneering work analyzed proteins from patient biopsies to create unique "fingerprints" for each HCA subtype and built a computer-based (machine learning) tool to match new cases against this library. This proteomic approach proved effective for diagnosing HCA subtypes, even in complex cases, and for identifying tumors with a higher risk of becoming malignant, offering a potential new tool to improve patient care.
